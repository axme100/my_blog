The largest campus with the greatest offering of postgraduate programs is called Ciudad Universitaria (CU) which is in the south of Mexico City. This guide will focus on applying to programs at CU. Most of the postgraduate programs run by the UNAM-CU hold administrative offices in a building called <em>Unidad de Posgrado</em> which is in the southern part of the campus.

For example, there are various <em>Facultades de Estudios Superiores</em> (FES) that offer other postgraduate degrees, including:</p>\n<p>a) <a href=\"https://www.acatlan.unam.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">FES Acatlán</a></p>\n<p>b) <a href=\"https://www.aragon.unam.mx/fes-aragon/#!/inicio\" target=\"_blank\">FES Aragón</a></p>\n<p>c) <a href=\"http://www.cuautitlan.unam.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">FES Cuautitlán</a></p>\n<p>d) <a href=\"http://www.iztacala.unam.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">FES Iztacala</a></p>\n<p>e) <a href=\"https://www.zaragoza.unam.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">FES Zaragoza</a></p>\n<p>FES Acatlán, for example, offers a postgraduate degree in Mexico-United States studies, a program not offered at CU.</p>\n<h1 id=\"pursuing-an-entire-degree\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pursuing-an-entire-degree\" aria-label=\"pursuing an entire degree permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pursuing an entire degree?</h1>\n<p>There are many different ways to get involved with the UNAM besides pursuing an entire postgraduate degree. For example, you can simply take classes as <a href=\"http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/es/main-menu/extranjeros-en-la-unam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a non-matriculated exchange student</a>. Or if you are looking to take Spanish classes, the <a href=\"http://www.cepe.unam.mx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CEPE (Centro de enseñanza de lenguas extranjeras)</a> offers Spanish as a foreign language classes at numerous centers both in Mexico and the United States. The UNAM also offers many <a href=\"http://educacioncontinua.cuaed.unam.mx/oferta.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">continuing education programs</a> such as <em>diplomados</em> (certificate programs). Also, check out the UNAM’s large list of <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/unam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MOOCS on Coursera</a>. A lot of programs can even be done online, so you don’t necessarily have to move to Mexico.</p>\n<p>You could even consider a specialization, something in between a <em>licenciatura</em> and a <em>maestría</em>. I think most specializations last about a year and you can even get scholarships for some of them.</p>\n<p>Ask in the comments section below if you are looking for ideas about ways to study at this prestigious institution.</p>\n<h1 id=\"why-do-a-masters-at-the-unam\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-do-a-masters-at-the-unam\" aria-label=\"why do a masters at the unam permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why do a Master’s at the UNAM?</h1>\n<p>In Mexico, the UNAM is known as la máxima casa de estudios, which is a bit like saying the “Harvard of Mexico”. But despite this slightly pretentious nickname, it is indeed one of the best universities in Mexico and the world <a href=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-nacional-autonoma-de-mexico-unam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">according to QS</a>. By studying here, you will certainly receive excellent training as well as invaluable cultural and linguistic knowledge. </p>\n<p>Learning or beefing up your Mexican Spanish is certainly a good move: it’s the most widely spoken variety of Spanish in the world (including the United States)! So, if you’re looking to do a masters or a Ph.D. in a Spanish-speaking country, ditch the <a href=\"https://dle.rae.es/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DRAE (Diccionario de la Real Academia de Español)</a> and pick up a copy of the <a href=\"http://dem.colmex.mx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DEM (Diccionario del Español de México)</a>.</p>\n<p>The UNAM also has a thriving institutional presence in the United States, both in terms of <a href=\"https://conahec.org/north-american-academic-partnerships-database?name_institution=&#x26;partner_name=&#x26;academic_field=&#x26;order=country&#x26;sort=desc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">binational academic partnerships</a> and administrative <a href=\"http://www.cepe.unam.mx/sedes.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">offices/independent Spanish schools as part of the CEPE</a>. This means more institutional recognition by US entities and also alumni support from the UNAM if and when you return to the United States.</p>\n<p>Overpriced schools in the US should take note: at the UNAM (and other public universities in Mexico) are tuition-free and you are even eligible to receive a scholarship from the Mexican government. (Yes, this is even true for non-Mexican-passport holders).</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-is-a-licenciatura\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-a-licenciatura\" aria-label=\"what is a licenciatura permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is a licenciatura?</h1>\n<p>A licenciatura in Mexico is the rough equivalent to a B.A. or a B.S. in the United States. However, unlike a liberal arts degree, for a licenciatura, students usually study the same subject throughout their 4-5-year undergraduate career. In addition, licenciatura students often must write and defend a thesis which can be quite a long and arduous process. Some students finish their classes, start working, and never <em>titularse</em> (finish their thesis). This means two things for your application to the UNAM or other postgraduate schools in Mexico:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will most likely need to turn in an official copy of your diploma in order to be considered for admission </li>\n<li>You will most likely be required to turn in a writing sample along with your application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This means that applying as a graduating senior is probably too soon because you won’t have your diploma in time to meet the graduation requirements, although it will depend on the program and you should always ask. I highly recommend taking a year off or get some working experience. Also, as far as I can tell the average age of postgraduate students at the UNAM is much higher than 22. This also means that opting for an honor’s thesis or capstone project is a really good idea as it could be a key component to your future application (which in my case painstakingly needed to be translated into Spanish).</p>\n<h1 id=\"a-note-on-cultural-differences\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-note-on-cultural-differences\" aria-label=\"a note on cultural differences permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A Note on cultural differences</h1>\n<p>For a stress free experience to apply to postgraduate degree programs in Mexico, it is important to understand that Mexican academic institutions tend to be more hierarchical and rule-abiding than their U.S. counterparts.

If you are an anthropologist or cultural studies major, I’m sure you can find better and more nuanced ways to compare two cultures, but I think these scales help make my point.

Power Distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally. At a score of 81, Mexico is a hierarchical society. This means that people accept a hierarchical order in which everybody has a place and which needs no further justification. Hierarchy in an organization is seen as reflecting inherent inequalities, centralization is popular, subordinates expect to be told what to do and the ideal boss is a benevolent autocrat.” (<a href=\"https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/mexico,the-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/mexico,the-usa/</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"uncertainty-avoidance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#uncertainty-avoidance\" aria-label=\"uncertainty avoidance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Uncertainty Avoidance:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The dimension Uncertainty Avoidance has to do with the way that a society deals with the fact that the future can never be known: should we try to control the future or just let it happen? This ambiguity brings with it anxiety and different cultures have learnt to deal with this anxiety in different ways. The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these is reflected in the score on Uncertainty Avoidance. Mexico scores 82 on this dimension and thus has a very high preference for avoiding uncertainty. Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas. In these cultures, there is an emotional need for rules (even if the rules never seem to work) time is money, people have an inner urge to be busy and work hard, precision and punctuality are the norm, innovation may be resisted, security is an important element in individual motivation.” (<a href=\"https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/mexico,the-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/mexico,the-usa/</a>) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my personal experience, these dimensions are reflected in numerous ways throughout the application process. For instance, imagine this hypothetical situation: it’s Monday morning and you make an inquiry to a professor by email about the program you are interested in. You may be redirected to a specific administrator whose role is to respond to inquiries from potential candidates, but then realize this person is on vacation until the following Monday and they only answers inquiries on Fridays before 2pm. This means you may have to wait 2 weeks for a response, and as easy as it would be for the professor to just give you the information, they may insist you go through the proper channels.\nBureaucracy tends to be more rigid than in the United States, so patience (but also persistence) are key.\nAnother way that the second dimension is reflected in the application process is through the use of a <em>Convocatoria</em> (In English: call for applications). At the UNAM, each program publishes their own <em>convocatoria</em> that stipulates specific rules for the application process. <em>Convocatorias</em> are very important, legally binding documents, that should be strictly adhered to in order to ensure fairness in the application process. For example, in my experience, the list of accepted candidates was published all at once on the program’s website. This is not like the United States where for example, individual offers are made to candidates until all of the positions are filled.</p>\n<h1 id=\"timeline-and-overview-of-application-requirements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#timeline-and-overview-of-application-requirements\" aria-label=\"timeline and overview of application requirements permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Timeline and Overview of Application Requirements</h1>\n<p>As mentioned in the last paragraph of the section above, your program’s <em>Convocatoria</em> will establish the application requirements.

Mexico and the United States both participate in the Hauge Convention so you will need to get an apostille stamps for the documents that are marked above. Apostille stamps (to the best of my knowledge) are given by the Secretary of State of your specific state (not Mike Pompeo, but your specific states’ Secretary of State). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Documents must be notarized before they are sent off for an apostille stamp in your specific state</em></strong>. Notarization is just a way to make a document official at the state level, and your university registrar (in the case of the official copy of the diploma) or the administrator of your states’ Department of Health (in the case of the birth certificate) should be able notarize these documents for you when you order them. In the case of your academic transcripts, I’m pretty sure that if they arrived ‘sealed’ to your Secretary of State, they will not require notarization.</p>\n<p>For the certified copy of your diploma and academic transcripts, hopefully your university has specific information listed online that explains how to obtain an apostille stamp for these documents. For example, the University of Washington lists information here <a href=\"https://registrar.washington.edu/students/apostille/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://registrar.washington.edu/students/apostille/</a>.</p>\n<p>In the case of birth certificate, hopefully your state’s Department of Health (or contracting agency) allows you to specify you need an apostille stamp upon ordering this document. This was the case for Washington State.</p>\n<p>An apostille stamp is just a piece of official paper stapled on top of a specific document. It looks like this:</p>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"/media/apostille.png\" alt=\"apostille.png\"></p>\n</center>\n<h1 id=\"certified-translations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#certified-translations\" aria-label=\"certified translations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Certified Translations</h1>\n<p>You will definitely need to have the documents listed above translated by a Mexican translator once they have the apostille stamp. Note: You should get all of the individual apostille stamp pages translated as well, even though it seems repetitive, make sure you get them. </p>\n<p>A certified Mexican Translator is known as a <em>perito</em> or <em>perito traductor</em>. In Mexican Spanish, <em>perito</em> roughly translates to a certified specialist, so in the case of a <em>perito</em> translator, this just means that they are certified by the Mexican Government.
