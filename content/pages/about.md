This is my new blog. Iâ€™ll be using this site to write about my personal and professional interests, which include linguistics (applied linguistics, Spanish linguistics, sociolinguistics, language teaching, phonetics/phonology, lexicography among others), web dev, data anaylsis, and outdoor education (just to name a few!).
