I thought I would nerd out on a roadmap of my current MOOC journey to retool for a career focused on Data Science (and hopefully NLP). My plan is to use this blog to keep track of my progress, stay motivated, take notes, and hopefully, inspire others to follow a similar path. Of course, I will also be codecrastinating around with html-css-javascript (just for fun)! The blog is composed of several steps that correspond to the subject areas important to Data Science and NLP:

1. Algebra, Trigonometry, Functions (Precalculus)
2. Calculus (Single Variable and Multivariate)
3. Probaility
4. Data Structures and Algorithms
5. Linear Algebra

To work on these steps, I have taken several classes at edX:

## Step 1: Algebra, Trigonometry, Functions (Precalculus)

<center>

$$ \huge {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

</center>

I have had some college-level training in algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics, however, I only took 1 class in each field, and the classes were designed for business majors which meant they lacked certain topics, especially revolving around trigonometry.

The first step in my plan is to brush up on algebra and precalculus, using EdX classes. The great thing about these courses is that they use ALEKS, an online learning platform that uses an AI algorithm to predict what you already know and give you an individualized path to mastering the content. <a href="https://sway.office.com/tFxqIGwGLW6DmseU" target=blank> This blog </a> explains the pros and cons of Khan Academy vs. ALEKS, arguing that Khan academy is better because of the superior gamification and positive user reinforcement built into the platform. However, for people like me, adult learners, whose interest and commitement in math waxed and waned throughout high school and college, I mastered certain topics but always had certain holes in my knowledge. Thus, I think the <a href="https://www.aleks.com/video/how_aleks_works" target=blank>AI behind ALEKS</a> will really help me focus on the things I don't already know and learn the content faster, Khan academy doesn't create an individualized path for each learner (at least not that I know). Anyway, ALEKS let's you click on a button to watch videos for certain topics when you get stuck, some of which are Khan Academy, and others are from Arizona State University, the institution behind the MOOCs:

1. College Algebra and Geometry, Arizona State University on edX  <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/3545df71ca804c18a0c28c95266ffb77" target=blank> Completed 10/22/2019 </a>

2. Precalculus, Arizona State University on edX  <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/ca400722e39142e29d12ea4c5d169f01" target=blank> Completed 10/23/2019 </a>

## Take-a-ways and resources from Algebra and Precalculus


  <p>Although my experience with ALEKS was great for the reasons I described above, at times the videos by Arizona State University were a bit robotic and dry. I often needed some more detailed explanations of certain topics, esepcially trigonometry. Here are some of the gems that I found:

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpXKiFjXjc&t=188s" target=blank> How to derive the unit circle </a> using special right triangles. This comes from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59w9x18hNNELpDvmo1UhVQ" target=blank> Simple Math </a> Youtube Channel which I highly reccomend.

2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW6Ua50fTw8&t=208s" target=blank> Memorize the first quadrant of unit cirlce and derive the rest by reflecting </a> (Brian McLogan) In this video, Mr. Brian Mclogan, explains how to memorize the first quadrant of the unit circle and then just derive the other points using reflections.

3. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/analytictrigonometry/" target=blank> Trigonometry Your Complete Guide </a> (Brian Mclogan). After working my way through this class, I had a solid foundation in trig and the problems on identities became easier to understand. Brian McLogans' videos (see above) are fantastic and many are available for free on You Tube.

4. <a href="https://www.mathbootcamps.com/the-pythagorean-identities-you-only-need-to-memorize-one/" target=blank> Deriving the pythogarean identies </a>

5. <a href="https://www.mathopenref.com/reference-angle.html" target=blank> Interactive visualization on reference angles </a>

6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOR1BiPyOkkIAnv9Cmj4iw" target=blank> Mario's Math Tutoring You Tube Channel </a> I have ran into a couple gems here too! But I haven't explored the channel as much as the ones above.

7. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6tHqOmIj1E"> Divisbility rules </a>

8. Kahn Academy Articles <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratics-multiplying-factoring/x2f8bb11595b61c86:factor-difference-squares/a/factoring-quadratics-difference-of-squares" target=blank> (example) </a> For me, the Kahn academy videos were quite slow, since I had seen a lot of this stuff already. Often times I found it helpful to look up a concept in a Kahn Academy article instead of a video, just appending "kahn article" to your google search should do the trick. For example, when working on factoring trigonometric identities, looking up the difference of squares method brought me to this excellent article: 



## Step 2: Calculus (Single and Multivariate)

<center>

$$ \huge \lim\limits_{h\rarr0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} $$

</center>


The next step is to take calculus classes. In college, I took a business calculus class, and loved it. However, it was only a 10-week course that focused mostly on derivatives (we only looked at integrals for 1 week). I can see that calculus is quite important for data science, according to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/mathematics-for-data-science-e53939ee8306" target=blank>this blog:</a>

> "[Calculus is] used in machine learning (&deep learning) to formulate the funcions used to train algorithms to rech their objective, known by loss/cost/objective functions"

I have also heard that integrals are key to understanding probability, the area under a curve represents the probability of something. Also, it looks like most people pursuing a B.S. need to have 3 foundational courses in calculus before moving on to more advanced topics. I am currently taking classes a two-semester advanced Calculus course at my University.



## Step 3: Probability

<center>

$$ \huge P(A|\textbf{B}) = P(A) \frac{P(\textbf{B} |A)}{P(\textbf{B})}$$

</center>

Up to this points, I have finished two Moocs on probability:

1. Fat Chance: Probability from the Ground Up, Harvard edX  <a href="https://profile.edx.org/u/axme100" target=blank> Completed 3/25/2020 </a>

2. Introduction to Probability  <a href="https://profile.edx.org/u/axme100" target=blank> Completed 5/29/2020 </a>

Fat Chance has high quality videos and focuses on dice and cards to explain certain concepts. The course, which covers concepts like counting, the multiplication princple, binomial and multinomial coeficients, and Bayes' Theorem is a good warm up for the second course. Introduction to Probability assumes some knowledge of Calculus. An advanced course in probability requires knowledge of multivariate calculus, thus I have one more course to take in the future once I reach this level of mathmatics.

## Take-a-ways and resources from Probability

1. http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/MATH/18/162
This guy has a lot of free lectures on different math classes which he gives at an excellent pace for my level of understanding. The probability lectures seem great, so far I've only watched the videos on sets and set theory.

2. Stat 110 Lectures on Youtube. These lectures complement the edX class but are not  a required part of this class. https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube

3. The law of total probability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3y8qupFfUs


4. Good practice problem on PMFs that is pretty abstract but seems to help with some of the basic ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx2NKaUCUw0

5. Good video and channel on binomial distributions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e04_wUoscBU. Didn't catch the part at the end after 10 minutes on cumulative distributions, but we can come to this later.

6. An awesome probability cheat sheet based on the same book that my probability edX probability class uses: https://www.wzchen.com/probability-cheatsheet/

7. Excellent video on indicator variables well explained with set theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaGcgPxfDoA
- Shoul dcome back and look at the other vieos this guy has.

# Step 4: Data Structures and Algorithms

I took completed the following MOOC:

1. Algorithmic Design and Techniques, UC San Diego on edX

While I do feel that taking this class was worth it, I found the lectures quite difficult to follow, and I do not think UC San Diego invested enough money in their production team, for example, often times the slides were quite overcrowded with notation. I plan to take a class on Data Structures next and I will be looking for other resources.


# Step 5: Linear Algebra

To be determined...
